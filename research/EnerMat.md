* Structural supercapacitors (SSCs) are a class of multifunctional composites that simultaneously provide load-carrying and energy storage capacities. This work presents a physics-based continuum multiscale electrochemical model aimed at understanding how design decisions in producing mechanically robust supercapacitors (SCs) composed of carbon aerogel-modified carbon fibre-reinforced electrodes in an ionic liquid electrolyte influence their electrochemical behaviour.  
* A pseudo 4D (P4D) model was proposed, which integrates a 3D macroscopic dynamic model to solve the charge transport while coupling a 1D microscopic equilibrium electric double layer (EDL) model to determine the local double layer capacitance of the porous electrode in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs). 
* In general, the proposed P4D model provides a numerical tool for analysing, developing, and optimising SSCs and more general SCs with porous electrodes in RTIL electrolytes.

Efficient storage and deployment of renewable energy sources like solar and wind are essential for achieving global CO2 reduction targets as energy demand is projected to rise by 25% by 2030. Insertion-electrode batteries, such as sodium-ion and lithium-ion, are key advancements in energy storage systems, but their performance is often limited by ion and electron transport inefficiencies and mechanical damage to electrodes. Improving battery performance requires controlling electrode nanoarchitecture, which presents a complex design challenge across multiple disciplines, including electrochemistry, solid mechanics, materials science, and mathematical optimization. 

* Renewable energy storage is critical to meeting CO2 reduction targets amid rising energy demand.
* Insertion-electrode batteries like Na-ion and Li-ion are pivotal in advanced energy storage but face performance limitations. Optimising electrode nanoarchitecture is essential for enhancing battery capacity, rate capability, and cycle life.
* This research integrates electrochemistry, solid mechanics, materials science, and mathematical optimization for optimal design.
