<h1> Research </h1>

Overview of the ongoing research topics and maybe also a summary of past research outcomes. Might put a slideshow like component to showcase some figures relevant to the researches. And each sub-page can have more details of the research topics.

Following is just a demonstration of what can be added:

> “I'm a scientist and I know what constitutes proof. But the reason I 
> call myself by my childhood name is to remind myself that a scientist 
must also be absolutely like a child. If he sees a thing, he must say 
that he sees it, whether it was what he thought he was going to see 
or not. See first, think later, then test. But always see first. 
Otherwise you will only see what you were expecting. 
Most scientists forget that.”
