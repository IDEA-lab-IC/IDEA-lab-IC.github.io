This work implements an eXtended PINNs (XPINNs)-based framework that utilises domain decomposition and demonstrates performance and capacity improvement over the PINN-based counterpart in multi-layer thermal history prediction of Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process.

* Significant improvement of prediction accuracy for multi-layer DED parts of simple geometry.
* Capability to account for complications such as dwell time and voids in design.
* Shares SciML-based framework’s meshless nature and immediate availability of derivative information.
* The scalable implementation of the framework allows a user defined number of sub-domains to be define. The code will be available shortly.

The proposed framework brings SciML-based framework for real-life DED applications one step closer with the expanded capability. Remarks on the appropriate level of domain decomposition are also made.

This project implements a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based solution framework that predicts the thermal history during a multi-layer Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process. 

* New opportunities for modelling the thermally induced distortion in metal AM with the meshless nature and the readily available derivative information from PINN solution.
* Overcomes the usual shortfall of neural networks (NNs) in dealing with discontinuities making multi-layer PINN-based simulation possible.
* Benchmark against ANSYS validates accuracy of the proposed framework to be comparable to numerical methods. Additionally, offering computational time-savings thereby making it amenable for use in design-optimisation algorithms.

The proposed framework sets the foundation for the subsequent exploration of applying scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques to real-life engineering applications. Furthermore, remarks on strategies to improve ease of training and prediction accuracy by PINN for the particular use case in DED temperature history prediction have been made.

We propose a novel lattice generation method that designs Functionally Graded Matamaterials (FGMMs) with the assistance of Topology Optimisation (TO) and Machine Learning (ML).

* A Neural Network (NN)-based inverse lattice generator is trained to output lattice unit cells from the input of target mechanical properties.
* Utilises information from fast low-resolution Topology Optimisation (TO) design to inform the trained inverse generator and map lattice cells.
* The proposed method provides close to optimal performance whilst making the realisation of these solutions exceptionally quick.

In this work, we proposed a ML-based inverse design framework to realise multi-material curved lattice structures, enabling the optimisation of multifunctional FGMs.

* The proposed unit cell design parameterisation enables simultaneous optimisation of shape, size and material, offering vast property space beyond conventional VF grading.
* High accuracy and efficiency in property prediction and inverse design by ML models, capable in handling mixed-type design features and properties across different physics.
* The MDN enables one-to-many inverse design, allowing further filtering based on manufacturability or other criteria.

A latent-space-arithmetic-based framework is proposed and developed in this project to generate smooth transition between dissimilar unit cells. It allows lattice structures with multiple unit cell types to be realised.
* Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is trained to map the unit cells to the latent space
* The proposed strategy ensures both smoothness in transition and connectivity with the target cells.
* Transitions between different types of triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) and truss-based unit cells can be generated.
Benchmark comparisons against analytical morphing and existing ML-based solutions indicate that the proposed framework consistently achieves superior performance.
