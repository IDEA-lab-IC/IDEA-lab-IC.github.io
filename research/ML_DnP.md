This project implements a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based solution framework that predicts the thermal history during a multi-layer Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process. 

* New opportunities for modelling the thermally induced distortion in metal AM with the meshless nature and the readily available derivative information from PINN solution.
* Overcomes the usual shortfall of neural networks (NNs) in dealing with discontinuities making multi-layer PINN-based simulation possible.
* Benchmark against ANSYS validates accuracy of the proposed framework to be comparable to numerical methods. Additionally, offering computational time-savings thereby making it amenable for use in design-optimisation algorithms.

The proposed framework sets the foundation for the subsequent exploration of applying scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques to real-life engineering applications. Furthermore, remarks on strategies to improve ease of training and prediction accuracy by PINN for the particular use case in DED temperature history prediction have been made.
