<h3> Fibre-Reinforced Additive Manufacturing: From Design Guidelines to Advanced Lattice Structures </h3>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The research encompasses three main topics, 1) design for additive manufacturing (DfAM), 2) fibre-reinforced additive manufacturing (FRAM) and 3) functionally graded lattices (FGLs).  

In developing an open-source FRAM solution, limitations of commercial printers in terms of toolpath control were overcome. Consequently, novel toolpath strategies and design guidelines/assessment criteria for the process planning with fibre-reinforced composites were established.  

A comprehensive database on strut- and surface-based FGLs was established by testing short fibre-reinforced lattices with continuously graded relative density and unit cell size. The work elucidated the effect of the severity of grading, lattice type, relative density and build direction on the elastic-plastic performance in comparison to ungraded lattice of equal weight. Subsequently, the measured data was used to inform a phenomenological constitutive model. The research has shown how such a homogenised model can be used to predict the large strain response of these advanced lattice structures at low computational cost compared to an explicit geometrical finite element model.
