We propose a novel lattice generation method that designs graded lattice structures with the assistance of Machine Learning (ML). 

* A Neural Network (NN)-based inverse lattice generator is trained to output lattice unit cells from the input of target mechanical properties. 
* Utilises information from fast low-resolution Topology Optimisation (TO) design to inform the trained inverse generator and map lattice cells. 
* The proposed method provides close to optimal performance whilst making the realisation of these solutions exceptionally quick.

</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
A latent-space-arithmetic-based framework is proposed and developed in this project to generate smooth transition between dissimilar unit cells. It allows lattice structures with multiple unit cell types to be realised. 

* Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is trained to map the unit cells to the latent space
* The proposed strategy ensures both smoothness in transition and connectivity with the target cells.
* Transitions between different types of triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) and truss-based unit cells can be generated.

Benchmark comparisons against analytical morphing and existing ML-based solutions indicate that the proposed framework consistently achieves superior performance.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project implements a physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based solution framework that predicts the thermal history during a multi-layer Directed Energy Deposition (DED) process. 

* New opportunities for modelling the thermally induced distortion in metal AM with the meshless nature and the readily available derivative information from PINN solution.
* Overcomes the usual shortfall of neural networks (NNs) in dealing with discontinuities making multi-layer PINN-based simulation possible.
* Benchmark against ANSYS validates accuracy of the proposed framework to be comparable to numerical methods. Additionally, offering computational time-savings thereby making it amenable for use in design-optimisation algorithms.

The proposed framework sets the foundation for the subsequent exploration of applying scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques to real-life engineering applications. Furthermore, remarks on strategies to improve ease of training and prediction accuracy by PINN for the particular use case in DED temperature history prediction have been made.

Efficient storage and deployment of renewable energy sources like solar and wind are essential for achieving global CO2 reduction targets as energy demand is projected to rise by 25% by 2030. Insertion-electrode batteries, such as sodium-ion and lithium-ion, are key advancements in energy storage systems, but their performance is often limited by ion and electron transport inefficiencies and mechanical damage to electrodes. Improving battery performance requires controlling electrode nanoarchitecture, which presents a complex design challenge across multiple disciplines, including electrochemistry, solid mechanics, materials science, and mathematical optimization. 

<b>Project at a glance:</b>

* Renewable energy storage is critical to meeting CO2 reduction targets amid rising energy demand.
* Insertion-electrode batteries like Na-ion and Li-ion are pivotal in advanced energy storage but face performance limitations. Optimising electrode nanoarchitecture is essential for enhancing battery capacity, rate capability, and cycle life.
* This research integrates electrochemistry, solid mechanics, materials science, and mathematical optimization for optimal design.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) is a surgical procedure to replace damaged hip joints, but a significant challenge is the need for costly revision surgeries due to implant failures, costing the UK's NHS over Â£60 million annually. The most common causes for revision are aseptic loosening and bone remodelling, both linked to inadequate implant design. This project aims to develop patient-specific implants using a multi-objective optimisation approach to minimize these risks by optimising implant topology. 

The collaboration between Imperial College London and the University of Birmingham integrates computational design, additive manufacturing, and experimental testing to create and validate functionally graded implants, potentially improving post-THA outcomes.

<b>Project at a glance:</b>

* THA revision surgeries are costly and often caused by risks of aseptic loosening and bone remodelling.
* The project aims to design patient-specific implants to reduce these revision risks. A multi-objective optimisation framework is proposed to find optimal implant topologies.
* Complementing computational design approach with additive manufacturing and experimental validation to test the optimised implants.

Our work has unravelled novel topologies for structual electrolyte materials which are considered pivotal for the development of structual batteries/supercapacitors. 

A three-dimensional finite element model for structural supercapacitors (SSCs) was developed to understand the electrochemical behaviour of both SSC devices as well as different constituents. A range of factors for the design of SSCs were extensively studied, including the separator thickness and porosity, and electrode thickness and fibre volume fraction. A galvanostatic charge and discharging (GCD) test was performed on the proposed model to obtain the specific capacitance, specific energy and specific power of the SSC device. The simulation results were then validated with the experimental data from our previous work regarding the performance criteria mentioned above. In general, this electrochemical model sets the stepping stone for further electro-chemo-mechanical models for SSCs, as well as promotes the development of virtual certification of SSC devices.
