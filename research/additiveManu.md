<h1> Additive Manufacturing </h1>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Within the realm of Addtive Manufacturing, our researches have revolved around the topics of 1) investigating the stiffness, strength, and functional performance of multi-material AM; 2) fibre-reinforced AM (FRAM) and robotic assisted manufacturing.

<h3> Review on Design and Structural Optimisation </h3>
<img src="/../_media/optiReview.jpg" style="width:100%">
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
As the application of additive manufacturing (AM) reaches an unprecedented scale in both academia and industry, a reflection upon the state-of-the-art developments in the design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) and structural optimisation, becomes vital for successfully shaping the future AM-landscape. A framework, highlighting both the interdependencies between these two central aspects in AM and the necessity for a holistic approach to structural optimization, using lightweight strategies such as topology optimization and/or latticing, was established to summarize the reviewed content. Primarily focusing on isotropic material considerations and basic stiffness-optimal problems, these concepts have already found wide application, bridging the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry. In pursuit of streamlining the AM-workflow towards digitally print-ready designs, studies are increasingly investigating mathematically-based structural optimization approaches in conjunction with DfAM-specific constraints, providing a portfolio of solutions like generative design, which is gaining traction in industry. Besides an overview on economically-driven to performance-driven design optimizations, insight into commercial AM-specific software is provided, elucidating potentials and challenges for the community. Despite the abundance of AM design methods to-date, computationally inexpensive solutions for common engineering problems are still scarce, which is constituting one of many key challenges for the future.

<h3> Fibre-Reinforced Additive Manufacturing: From Design Guidelines to Advanced Lattice Structures </h3>
<img src="/../_media/lattice.png" style="width:100%">
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The research encompasses three main topics, 1) design for additive manufacturing (DfAM), 2) fibre-reinforced additive manufacturing (FRAM) and 3) functionally graded lattices (FGLs).  

In developing an open-source FRAM solution, limitations of commercial printers in terms of toolpath control were overcome. Consequently, novel toolpath strategies and design guidelines/assessment criteria for the process planning with fibre-reinforced composites were established.  

A comprehensive database on strut- and surface-based FGLs was established by testing short fibre-reinforced lattices with continuously graded relative density and unit cell size. The work elucidated the effect of the severity of grading, lattice type, relative density and build direction on the elastic-plastic performance in comparison to ungraded lattice of equal weight. Subsequently, the measured data was used to inform a phenomenological constitutive model. The research has shown how such a homogenised model can be used to predict the large strain response of these advanced lattice structures at low computational cost compared to an explicit geometrical finite element model.

<h3> Review on 3D printing to enable multifunctionality in polymer-based composites </h3>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The employment of 3D printing for the fabrication of advanced multi-functional composites is attracting increased interest of the research community due to the opportunities offered by this technology (i.e. the wide range of materials that can be printed, short time, low costs). Numerous attempts are being presented every year regarding the incorporation of specific functionalities such as conductive, magnetic, embedded circuitry, thermal, sensing and self-healing to composites by employing different 3D printing processes and materials. This review provides an overview of the main functionalities that have been incorporated, homogeneously or locally, to polymer based composite materials via 3D printing. A strong emphasis is laid on the two main pillars enabling functionalisation: additives and printing methods. Finally, promise offered by the maturation of technology and recommendation on research efforts that are imminently needed to fulfil the untapped potential of functional 3D printing is given.
