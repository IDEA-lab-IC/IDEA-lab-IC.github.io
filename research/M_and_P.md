This study experimentally investigates the dynamic response of AM lattices under varied impact energy. The examined lattice parameters include unit cell topology, grading strategy (relative density and cell size grading), testing direction, and the integration of carbon fibres into the polymer-based material.

*	The dynamic mechanical properties are influenced by the overall relative density and unit cell topology. 
* Fibre-reinforced lattice structures exhibit greater energy absorption than pure polymer, with a 37.6% in the benchmark case. 
* These experimental insights enrich the understanding of lattice dynamic behaviour and support the adoption of AM composite in crash protection applications.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) exhibits remarkable shape memory behaviour due to its inherent phase-separated microstructure. This property can be utilised in the development of morphing structures within the field of aeronautics. Complex structures can be fabricated via additive manufacturing, a sustainable and economical processing technique. 

This study focuses on the material and structural development of a novel shape memory polymer nanocomposite.

*	The printability, mechanical properties, and shape memory performance of TPU are expected to improve by blending it with other thermoplastics, such as Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS).
*	Further enhancement of shape memory behaviour can be achieved by reinforcing the polymer blend with carbon-based fillers, such as Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) and Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNPs). These fillers enhance thermal and electrical conductivity, enabling electrical actuation of the shape memory composite and improving mechanical performance.
*	Our objective is to achieve flexible prototyping using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) with the composite for morphing applications.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
A comprehensive database on strut- and surface-based FGLs was established by testing short fibre-reinforced lattices with continuously graded relative density and unit cell size. 

*	The work elucidated the effect of the severity of grading, lattice type, relative density and build direction on the elastic-plastic performance.
*	Subsequently, the measured data was used to inform a phenomenological constitutive model. The research has shown how a homogenised model can be used to predict the large strain response of lattice structures at low computational cost compared to FE model.
