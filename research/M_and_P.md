This study presents a novel design approach that introduces the bouligand fibre arrangement in a honeycomb structure realising by the continuous fibre reinforcement AM technique. We are aiming to explore the capabilities of this proposed nature-inspired approach for improving out-of-plane strength and toughness. In additional, for engineering applications, further investigation will be conducted on the performance of the design as the core of sandwich structure.

*	The bio-inspired honeycomb shows different deformation modes where no visible buckling or delamination at the mid-plane. We are aiming to further the understanding of fracture mechanism of the proposed design.
*	Varying a pitch angle shows an effect on mechanical properties and thus, will be one of crucial design parameter.
*	The proposed design presents a promising approach to enhance the properties of honeycombs and afford the flexibility to improve toughness and energy absorption capabilities.

<h3> Fibre-Reinforced Additive Manufacturing: From Design Guidelines to Advanced Lattice Structures </h3>
<img src="/../_media/lattice.png" style="width:100%">
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The research encompasses three main topics, 1) design for additive manufacturing (DfAM), 2) fibre-reinforced additive manufacturing (FRAM) and 3) functionally graded lattices (FGLs).  

In developing an open-source FRAM solution, limitations of commercial printers in terms of toolpath control were overcome. Consequently, novel toolpath strategies and design guidelines/assessment criteria for the process planning with fibre-reinforced composites were established.  

A comprehensive database on strut- and surface-based FGLs was established by testing short fibre-reinforced lattices with continuously graded relative density and unit cell size. The work elucidated the effect of the severity of grading, lattice type, relative density and build direction on the elastic-plastic performance in comparison to ungraded lattice of equal weight. Subsequently, the measured data was used to inform a phenomenological constitutive model. The research has shown how such a homogenised model can be used to predict the large strain response of these advanced lattice structures at low computational cost compared to an explicit geometrical finite element model.

<h3> Review on 3D printing to enable multifunctionality in polymer-based composites </h3>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/../_media/research/YW.jpg" style="width:50%">
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
The employment of 3D printing for the fabrication of advanced multi-functional composites is attracting increased interest of the research community due to the opportunities offered by this technology (i.e. the wide range of materials that can be printed, short time, low costs). Numerous attempts are being presented every year regarding the incorporation of specific functionalities such as conductive, magnetic, embedded circuitry, thermal, sensing and self-healing to composites by employing different 3D printing processes and materials. This review provides an overview of the main functionalities that have been incorporated, homogeneously or locally, to polymer based composite materials via 3D printing. A strong emphasis is laid on the two main pillars enabling functionalisation: additives and printing methods. Finally, promise offered by the maturation of technology and recommendation on research efforts that are imminently needed to fulfil the untapped potential of functional 3D printing is given.
