As the application of additive manufacturing (AM) reaches an unprecedented scale in both academia and industry, a reflection upon the state-of-the-art developments in the design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) and structural optimisation, becomes vital for successfully shaping the future AM-landscape. 

A framework, highlighting both the interdependencies between these two central aspects in AM and the necessity for a holistic approach to structural optimization, using lightweight strategies such as topology optimization and/or latticing, was established to summarize the reviewed content. Primarily focusing on isotropic material considerations and basic stiffness-optimal problems, these concepts have already found wide application, bridging the gaps between design and manufacturing as well as academia and industry. 

In pursuit of streamlining the AM-workflow towards digitally print-ready designs, studies are increasingly investigating mathematically-based structural optimization approaches in conjunction with DfAM-specific constraints, providing a portfolio of solutions like generative design, which is gaining traction in industry. 

Besides an overview on economically-driven to performance-driven design optimizations, insight into commercial AM-specific software is provided, elucidating potentials and challenges for the community. Despite the abundance of AM design methods to-date, computationally inexpensive solutions for common engineering problems are still scarce, which is constituting one of many key challenges for the future.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This review provides an overview of the main functionalities that have been incorporated, homogeneously or locally, to polymer based composite materials via 3D printing. A strong emphasis is laid on the two main pillars enabling functionalisation: additives and printing methods. Finally, promise offered by the maturation of technology and recommendation on research efforts that are imminently needed to fulfil the untapped potential of functional 3D printing is given.
