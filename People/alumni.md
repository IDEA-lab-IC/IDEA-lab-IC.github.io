		Chanhui joined Composite Centre and Dr Ajit Panesar’s research group at Imperial College London (ICL) in April 2017, where he focused his research on ‘Design, Characterisation and Application of Structural and Multifunctional Composites to Large Ship Structures’. During his PhD, he enjoyed numerical and experimental investigations for design, optimisation and validation of multifunctional composites under the great guidance of Prof. Emile S. Greenhalgh (the Head of Composite Centre at ICL) and Dr Ajit Panesar (the Head of Idea lab).
	</p>
	<p>
		Chanhui is currently working as a senior research engineer in the Innovative machinery system research department at  <a style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="http://www.ksoe.co.kr/en/">Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE)</a> in South Korea. He es focusing on the innovation and development of mechanical systems in marine and offshore structures. 
	</p>
	</p>	
		More recently, he has been promoted as the head of the Innovative machinery system research department, and he is, therefore, trying to build a cooperative research relationship with  IDEA lab and Composite Centre for successful collaborations in near future.

		With a B.Sc. in Sports engineering from the Technical University Chemnitz and a M.Sc. in Composite Materials from Imperial College London, my background is in mechanical engineering and material science. Being a passionate climber, runner, and golfer, I have always been fascinated by the technology and materials used to develop better performing and lighter equipment. With the PhD research into additive manufacturing of composites, I had the opportunity to work on lightweight structures that have potential applications in this field. Furthermore, I am fascinated by the immense potential of additive manufacturing, transforming the way we design products and offering new and exciting solutions. After having collected significant experiences in the experimental testing of materials (polymers, metals, and ceramics), the motivation for this research also stemmed from the desire to expand my knowledge in the numerical simulation.

		I like to study polymer material with a BSc in polymer and a MSc in composite science and engineering, respectively. Now my PhD research interest is additive manufacturing of fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) and investigation on their mechanical performance. Additive manufacturing attracts increasing attention as it develops from fabricating only prototypes to manufacture engineering components. However, the mechanical performance of additively manufactured parts still needs improvement and more relative research efforts are needed. My current study is investigating factors influencing the mechanical performance of FRPs by experimental characterisation. I like to use characterising technologies to analysis the structure of additively manufactured FRPs and investigate how the structure influences the mechanical performance.
