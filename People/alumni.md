	Ck was a Research Associate at the Materials department of Imperial College London. His research revolved around multiscale design of architected materials. These are materials which derive their functional behaviour from the microstructures they are comprised of. Some interesting applications of such materials are in the design of bespoke bone implants and aerospace grade structures. He demonstrated that novel lattice structures based on the mathematics of aperiodic order have the capacity to outdo their rather ubiquitous periodic counterparts. Ck also applied his expertise in multiscale optimisation to derive nanoscale topologies for state-of-the-art insertion electrode batteries such as Li-ion, Nickel Metal Hydride and Sodium-ion batteries, further improving battery performance (energy and power densities) as well as battery life-time.

<p>
	Ck is currently a lecturer in design optimisation at University of Manchester.

		My investigation focused on applying Machine Learning (ML) in Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM), especially in Design of lattice structures. Lattice structures are architectures constructed by spatial periodic cells. The controllable shape and size, the high strength-to-weight ratio, and the tuneable mechanical properties have brought lattice structures greater attention. I'm trying to seek for sophisticated lattice generation methods which could use ML to enhance the structural performance. I believe that lattice structures can approximate the high performance of Topology Optimisation (TO) design, but shrink the time required for generating high-resolution structures. Recent work applying ML-based lattice inverse design to functionally-graded lattice generation is published in AM journal (doi:10.1016/j.addma.2022.103238). I'm now looking into exploiting multi-functionality of lattice designs and lattice-based compliant mechanisms. Further investigation into lattice behaviour under plastic deformation is also expected to help improve lattice energy absorption capability.

		John's project spanned the design, manufacture, and operation of custom-made vacuum cold spray system for in-space manufacturing and repair, and was funded by the UK space agency (UKSA). Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) systems are already being used on Earth for additive manufacturing and repair of metal components under atmospheric conditions. This project evaluated the feasibility of CSAM for in-situ (in-free space) repairs of spacecraft components, demonstrating expertise in computational and experimental methods to enable CSAM. It also enabled translation of low-TRL research from university to industry.

		Chanhui joined Composite Centre and Dr Ajit Panesar’s research group at Imperial College London (ICL) in April 2017, where he focused his research on ‘Design, Characterisation and Application of Structural and Multifunctional Composites to Large Ship Structures’. During his PhD, he enjoyed numerical and experimental investigations for design, optimisation and validation of multifunctional composites under the great guidance of Prof. Emile S. Greenhalgh (the Head of Composite Centre at ICL) and Dr Ajit Panesar (the Head of Idea lab).
	</p>
	<p>
		Chanhui is currently working as a senior research engineer in the Innovative machinery system research department at  <a style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="http://www.ksoe.co.kr/en/">Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE)</a> in South Korea. He es focusing on the innovation and development of mechanical systems in marine and offshore structures. 
	</p>
	</p>	
		More recently, he has been promoted as the head of the Innovative machinery system research department, and he is, therefore, trying to build a cooperative research relationship with  IDEA lab and Composite Centre for successful collaborations in near future.

		With a B.Sc. in Sports engineering from the Technical University Chemnitz and a M.Sc. in Composite Materials from Imperial College London, my background is in mechanical engineering and material science. Being a passionate climber, runner, and golfer, I have always been fascinated by the technology and materials used to develop better performing and lighter equipment. With the PhD research into additive manufacturing of composites, I had the opportunity to work on lightweight structures that have potential applications in this field. Furthermore, I am fascinated by the immense potential of additive manufacturing, transforming the way we design products and offering new and exciting solutions. After having collected significant experiences in the experimental testing of materials (polymers, metals, and ceramics), the motivation for this research also stemmed from the desire to expand my knowledge in the numerical simulation.

		I like to study polymer material with a BSc in polymer and a MSc in composite science and engineering, respectively. Now my PhD research interest is additive manufacturing of fibre reinforced polymers (FRPs) and investigation on their mechanical performance. Additive manufacturing attracts increasing attention as it develops from fabricating only prototypes to manufacture engineering components. However, the mechanical performance of additively manufactured parts still needs improvement and more relative research efforts are needed. My current study is investigating factors influencing the mechanical performance of FRPs by experimental characterisation. I like to use characterising technologies to analysis the structure of additively manufactured FRPs and investigate how the structure influences the mechanical performance.

<p>
	Rachel's research project was on designing, developing, and demonstrating a cold spray additive manufacturing device for in-space applications
</p>
<p>
	Cold spray additive manufacturing systems are already being used on Earth for 3D printing of metal components under atmospheric conditions. By developing a cold spray system that can operate under high vacuum conditions, and by demonstrating successful operation within a high vacuum environment, the applications of this type of technology will be broadened to include in-space operation, thus, allowing for in-situ repairs of spacecraft. This will help to increase the lifetime of spacecraft while reducing the repair mass requirements by using a material that can be sprayed into the required shape instead of carrying a variety of specific components.
