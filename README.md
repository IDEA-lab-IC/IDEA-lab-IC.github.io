<h1> Good {{timeOfDay}}! Welcome to IDEA Lab! </h1>

<!-- Innovative DEsign & Advanced manufacturing (IDEA) Lab is established in 2021 at Imperial College London. Consists of 5 PhD researchers, 2 research associates, and led by Dr Ajit Panesar, the group's work revolves around 3 main categories: Multifunctional Meta-materials, Optimisation and Machine Learning in Design for Additive Manufacturing, and Additive Manufacturing. Despite of being young, the group has produced 2 review papers with over 200 citations in the last 2 years.  -->

<h2> Research Overview </h2>

</div>

We, at IDEA Lab, are driven by the possibility to create tangible impact across a wide-ranging sectors by focusing on ubiquitous underpinning engineering objectives. For example, designing optimal structures for: light-weighting, vibration-resilience, thermal-efficiency, and multi-functionality.

To meet this aspiration, we adopt an experimentally validated, computational approach to guide our designs.
  * We have successfully leveraged and fused ML and TO paradigms to enable the rapid discovery of solutions for challenging multi-physics and multi-objective problem.
  * Our physical experimentation and manufacturing efforts, particularly, relating to manufacture of composite materials  Capitalising on AM and Robotic assisted manufacturing for composite materialsâ€¦

<!-- Here we can see some highlight examples of the work undertaken by the group which is headed by Dr Ajit Panesar:
An ML approach for the design of multifunctional metamaterials meeting multiple objectives incl. stiffness and thermal requirements.
A multiphysics-based TO implementation, aiding the discovery of novel battery electrode architectures.
Functionally graded lattices being investigated for their elastic-plastic response. -->
