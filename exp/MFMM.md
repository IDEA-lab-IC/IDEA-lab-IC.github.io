Our current research in MFMM attempts to answer the questions on what MFMM looks like for structural batteries and the development of high-energy-absorbing meta-materials. It is part of the group effort of Imperial College London's <a style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/structural-power-composites/team/" target = "_blank">Structural Power Composites team</a> in the Department of Aeronautics. It is also co-supervised by <a style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/e.greenhalgh" target = "_blank">Professor Emile S Greenhalgh</a> from the Department of Aeronautics at Imperial College London.
