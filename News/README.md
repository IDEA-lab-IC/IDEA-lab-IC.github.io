<h2> Computational tools: Pushing the Frontiers of DfAM - a XXXX Event </h2>
IDEA lab will host *event's name* from xx/xx/2021 to xx/xx/2021. 

DfAM is slowly but steadily seeing a shift from a more expertise driven discipline to a more data driven one. The emergence and maturation of powerful methods such as topology optimisation approaches that encompass infills/lattice and considers manufacturability and material anisotropy is challenging the status-quo of what DfAM entails.

This thematic area intends to bring experts, practitioners and enthusiasts alike from academia and industry to help define what role does computational tools play in the future direction of DfAM.
