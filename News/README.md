In partnership with  the DfAM Network, IDEA lab will host Computational tools: Pushing the Frontiers of DfAM on <b> 10th November 2021 (WED) </b>.

DfAM is slowly but steadily seeing a shift from a more expertise driven discipline to a more data driven one. The emergence and maturation of powerful methods such as topology optimisation approaches that encompass infills/lattice and considers manufacturability and material anisotropy is challenging the status-quo of what DfAM entails.

This thematic area intends to bring experts, practitioners and enthusiasts alike from academia and industry to help define what role does computational tools play in the future direction of DfAM.
