For example, designing optimal structures for: light-weighting, vibration-resilience, thermal-efficiency, and multi-functionality. -->

<!-- Innovative DEsign & Advanced manufacturing (IDEA) Lab is established in 2021 at Imperial College London. Consists of 5 PhD researchers, 2 research associates, and led by Dr Ajit Panesar, the group's work revolves around 3 main categories: Multifunctional Meta-materials, Optimisation and Machine Learning in Design for Additive Manufacturing, and Additive Manufacturing. Despite of being young, the group has produced 2 review papers with over 200 citations in the last 2 years.  -->

<!-- <h2> Research Overview </h2>

<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/../_media/overview.png" style="width:75%">
</div>

<div align="justify">

To meet this aspiration, our efforts are on the development of computational design tools. Validating the relevance of these often require a thorough understanding of materials and processes employed. We adopt an experimentally validated, computational approach to guide our designs and have successfully leveraged and fused ML and TO paradigms to enable the rapid discovery of solutions for challenging multi-physics and multi-objective problems.
Working with AM and Robotic assisted manufacturing for composite materials, we realise complex lattices or metamaterials and characterise their composition/properties/performance.

</div> -->


<!-- Here we can see some highlight examples of the work undertaken by the group which is headed by Dr Ajit Panesar:
An ML approach for the design of multifunctional metamaterials meeting multiple objectives incl. stiffness and thermal requirements.
A multiphysics-based TO implementation, aiding the discovery of novel battery electrode architectures.
Functionally graded lattices being investigated for their elastic-plastic response. -->
